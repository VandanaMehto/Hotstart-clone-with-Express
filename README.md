# Hotstart-clone-with-Express

I made a clone hotstart with express . In this code I used crud method. Like get,put,post and delete method. It is a very simple programe for beginner for understand purpose that how we can use express Framwork.

## Learn how to use crud method with express.

1. get method for displaying purpose means if you are using .get you can you only get files.

2. put method for updating the data from server site but you need to use postman.

3. if you will be using post and delete method so you have to use postman app. without postman you cannot post and check your code.

4. besically, we need a postman app because browser only accept html code and get code Browser can't accept post and delete method.

5. I use params keyword in delete method because I need to delete specific id and params only the way to delete value by id.
